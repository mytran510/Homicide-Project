# Introduction!


[Link here for the murder data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/murderaccountability/homicide-reports)


This dataset was Homicide Reports information. Through our analyzes we will find approaches to our findings. Our data will give a visualization and identify correlations within these murders throughout the year of 1980-2014.



# Our Questions 
__Domain Question__
What factors are related to __motives__ and __behaviors__ of the killers? 

__Other questions__

what _weapon_ was used the most?

what _state_ had the most kills?

do the _victims_ know their perpetrator?

How does _gender_ play a role in homicide incidents?

# Peering into the Unfiltered Murder data Set



__Original dataset__ we have is from Kaggle, "Homicide Report". Firstly, we take a look at data.

```{r}
unzip(zipfile="./homicide.zip")
data <- read.csv("database.csv")
glimpse(data) 


```

---

__Data Key Terms:__

__Agency Type__: Law enforcement Agency who handled the case

__State/City__: State and Counties of the reported homicides

__Year/Month__: Time stamp of the homicides

__Crime Type__: Murder, Manslaughter or Negligence designated to case

__Crime Solved__: Whether the case has been solved or not

__Victim Sex/Age/Race__: Victim profile

__Perpetrator Sex/Age/Race__: Perpetrator profile

__Relationship__: The perpetrators relation to the victim

__Weapon__: Weapon used to commit homicide

__Case Open/Closed__: Change the designation of a crime being solved.

__Solve Rate__: Percentage of Homicide Reports where the case was closed


---

__Top murder cases by state,__ we taking the raw dataset to display the top murder cases by State.

```{r, message=FALSE}
data %>% group_by(State) %>% 
  summarize(Murder_Count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Murder_Count)) %>% 
  kbl() %>% kable_paper()  %>% scroll_box(height = "800px")
```

```{r, echo=F,fig.height=10, fig.width=12, message=F}
data %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~State) %>% 
  add_histogram(color = I("red"), 
                stroke = I("black"), 
                span = I(2)
                , alpha = 0.6) %>% group_by(State) %>%
  summarise(Murder_Count = n()) %>% 
  layout(title = "Histogram of States count by Murder Cases", xaxis = list(title = "States"), yaxis = list(title = "Murder Case Count"))
```


_In table and graph, they show us that the state with the most kills in which California is the state with the most murder cases with Texas coming in second and New York third._

---

__Top 10 States with the highest amount of cases.__

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=10, fig.width=12, message=FALSE}
                                                                 
top10_Murder_Cases <- data %>% group_by(State) %>% summarize(Murder_Count = n()) %>% arrange(desc(Murder_Count)) %>% head(10) 
top10_Murder_Cases

# I shown the top Murder Cases count in the Histogram to compare 
top10_Murder_Cases %>% plot_ly(x = ~Murder_Count, y = ~State, color = I("dark red"), 
                stroke = I("black"), 
                span = I(2)
                , alpha = 0.6)%>% layout(title = "Histogram of top 10 States By Murder Case", xaxis = list(title = "States"), yaxis = list(title = "Murder Case Count"))

```



---

__What is the most used weapon?,__ we count how many times killers used each kind of weapons to see the top of their weapon choice.

```{r}
data %>% group_by(Weapon) %>% 
  summarize(Most_Weapon_Used = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Most_Weapon_Used)) %>% 
  kbl() %>% kable_paper() %>% scroll_box(height = "800px")
```

_Here you can see that the handgun is the most "favorite" weapon of serial killers compare to other weapons._

---

__Murder Cases in USA__

Here we wanted to visualize the highest crime counts in the US. Heatmaps are great when focusing on locations that matter the most. In this case, we see CA being red compare to other states. Also, in this heatmap, it shows how in Northern US there is less crime count.

```{r echo=FALSE, results=FALSE, fig.width=19, fig.height=16, message=FALSE, warning=F }


states <- states(cb = TRUE, class = "sf") %>% 
  filter(!as.numeric(STATEFP) %in% c(2, 15, 60, 66, 69, 72, 78)) %>%
  mutate(var = rnorm(nrow(.)))

data_murder_by_states <- data %>% group_by(State) %>% summarize(murder = n()) %>% arrange(desc(murder))

heatmap_data_murder_by_states <- states %>% left_join(data_murder_by_states, by = c('NAME' = 'State'))

ggplot(heatmap_data_murder_by_states) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = murder ), colour = alpha("black", 1 / 2), size = 0.2) +   
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "turbo" , 
                       begin = 0.1, name = "Murder Count",label = scales::comma) + geom_sf_text(aes(label = NAME), colour = "black") + 
  labs(title = "Heat Map of the United States", 
      subtitle = "Count by Murder in each State") + 
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(colour = "black")) + 
theme_bw() 
```


---

__Murder Cases in California and Texas__
 
Now lets focus on the best state of the US, Texas. Unfortunately, Texas comes in second with the biggest crime rates. We wanted to see what county had the biggest crime rate. Harris county had the highest crime rate.

We wanted to include California since it has the highest among all other states to see where most of the murders are.  
California is broken down into cities instead of counties.

```{r, fig.width=19, fig.height=16, echo=FALSE, results=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Error=FALSE}

Texas <- tigris:: counties(state = "TX", cb = T, class ='sf')

Data_City_by_Murder <- data %>% group_by(City) %>% summarize(Murder = n()) %>% arrange(desc(Murder))

heat_map_of_Texas <- Texas %>% left_join(Data_City_by_Murder, by = c("NAME" = 'City'))


ggplot(heat_map_of_Texas) + geom_sf(aes(fill = Murder)) + scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "inferno" , begin = 0.1, label = scales::comma) + stat_sf_coordinates() + theme(legend.position="right",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,color = "dark red", size = 16, face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "dark red", size = 14, face = "bold"),
        plot.caption = element_text(color = "Gray60"))+ 
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Murder Count", title.position = "top", title.theme =element_text(size = 10, face = "bold",colour = "Black",angle = 0))) + geom_sf_text(aes(label = NAME), colour = "grey", alpha = 0.6) + labs(title = "Murder Count by Counties in Texas", subtitle = "1980 to 2014")


```

# This is the heatmap for California 
ggplot(data = heat_map_of_California) + geom_sf(aes(fill = Murder), color = "black", size = 0.5) + scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "mako" , begin = 0.1, label = scales::comma) + stat_sf_coordinates() + theme(legend.position="right",

```

__Genders of Victim by State__, we count amount of cases based on data about genders by state.


```{r, echo=FALSE, results=FALSE, fig.width= 18, fig.height= 15, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Here I took the dataset to combine the total amount of Female count by state with Male total count together into 1 dataset to compare it. 
# I even have one with the unknown to compare it 
Female_Data <-  data %>% group_by(State, Victim.Sex) %>% summarize(Female_Total = n()) %>% filter(Victim.Sex == "Female")

# made a male data set of count 
Male_Data <- data %>% group_by(State, Victim.Sex) %>% summarize(Male_Total = n()) %>% filter(Victim.Sex == "Male")

# made male dataset 
Unknown_Data <- data %>% group_by(State, Victim.Sex) %>% summarize(Unknown_Total = n()) %>% filter(Victim.Sex == "Unknown")

Gender_Data <- Female_Data %>% left_join(Male_Data, by = "State")

Gender_Data_with_Total<- Gender_Data %>% mutate(Sum_Gender = Female_Total + Male_Total)

Gender_Data_plus_Unknown <- Gender_Data %>% left_join(Unknown_Data, by = "State")


Gender_Data_for_3D <- Gender_Data_plus_Unknown %>% mutate(Unknown_Total = ifelse(is.na(Unknown_Total), 0, Unknown_Total)) %>% mutate(Sum_Gender = Female_Total + Male_Total + Unknown_Total) 


 Gender_heatmap <- states %>% left_join(Gender_Data_for_3D, by = c("NAME" = "State"))


ggplot(Gender_heatmap) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = Female_Total), colour = alpha("black", 1 / 2), size = 0.2) +   
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma" , 
                       begin = 0.1, name = "Murder Count",label = scales::comma) + geom_sf_text(aes(label = NAME), colour = "black") + 
  labs(title = "Heat Map by Female Murder Cases", 
      subtitle = " By each State") + theme(panel.background = element_rect(colour = "black")) + 
theme_bw() 


ggplot(Gender_heatmap) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = Male_Total), colour = alpha("black", 1 / 2), size = 0.2) +   
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "brewer blues" , 
                       begin = 0.1, name = "Murder Count",label = scales::comma) + geom_sf_text(aes(label = NAME), colour = "black") + 
  labs(title = "Heat Map by Male Murder Cases", 
      subtitle = "By each State") + theme(panel.background = element_rect(colour = "black")) + 
theme_bw() 


```

__Is there any missing or unknown data in this dataset?__

```{r} 
#As an example, let's see how they show in gender of victims field!
data %>% group_by(Victim.Sex) %>% summarize(Gender = n())
```

_In this table as you can see, we have 984 that are unknown so we need to tidy up our data and get rid of the unknowns._


```{r}

#How about Unknown Weapon?
data %>% group_by(Weapon) %>% 
  summarize(Most_Weapon_Used = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Most_Weapon_Used)) %>% 
  kable() %>% kable_paper() %>% scroll_box(height = "800px")
```

_Here you can see that the handgun is the most "favorite" weapon of serial killers compare to other weapons._


---

__Let's see how the distribution of cases by victims' ages is based on data we have!__

```{r, message = F, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
# Graph for cases by age
data %>% ggplot(aes(Victim.Age)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 50) + 
  labs(title = "How many cases over victims' ages?", 
       x = "Age of Victim (years old)", y = "Cases")
```

_From then, we see that there are many cases with nearly 1000 year-old victims. It doesn't make sense so then we proceeded to filter our data to make it more neat and coherent._


---

# Filtered Data  

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
filtered_data <- data %>% 
  select(Year, Victim.Age, Victim.Sex, Relationship, Weapon) %>% 
  filter(Relationship != 'Unknown') %>% 
  filter(Weapon != 'Unknown') %>% 
  filter(Victim.Sex != 'Unknown') %>% 
  filter(Victim.Age %in% c(1:100))
glimpse(filtered_data)

```

In our filtered data we decided to work with data that we would find useful for our findings and remove all the 'unknowns' in the dataset. In our new filtered data we decided to work with __Year, Victim's Age, Victim's Sex, Relationship to their perpetrator and type of Weapon__ used in each incident. We also filtered the victim's age to be more accurate from combining them from __age 1 to 100.__ 


---

# Analyze factors and link to our question

## 1. Year:

We wanted to observe the number of cases throughout the three decades. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=F,warning = F}
# How many cases by year?
filtered_data %>% count(Year)  %>% 
  kbl() %>% kable_paper()  %>% scroll_box(height = "800px")
```


---

_Now with our filtered data, we wanted to see the crimes rates throughout the years of 1980-2014. In 1980 & 1993, you can see that there is a peak in crimes rates but then they start to decreased. In 1980, the crime rate was high due to a severe global economic recession and inflation peaked in the US by 14.76%_

```{r,message=FALSE,fig.width=10, fig.height=7}
# The rate of murders during the period of 1980-2014
filtered_data %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarise(murder = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Year,murder)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

---

## 2. Relationship between them:

Then we wanted to see if the perpetrator had knew their victim before striking. So we made a variable based on their relationship. 

```{r,echo=FALSE, message=F, warning=F}
#Define if they know each other
relationship_data <- filtered_data %>% 
  mutate(Relationship_with_murder = (Relationship == "Stranger")) %>% 
  mutate_all(funs(replace(.,. == "TRUE", "Unknown"))) %>% 
  mutate_all (funs(replace(.,. == "FALSE", "Known")))
glimpse(relationship_data)
```

---

_Looking at this table, it there is a higher chance that the victim knows their perpetrator._

```{r}
#Count how many cases they know each other
relationship_data %>% group_by(Relationship_with_murder) %>% summarise(cases = n())
```


```{r,echo=F, message = F, warning = F, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
# Graph for Relationship with Murder
table_relationship <- relationship_data %>% group_by(Relationship_with_murder) %>% summarise(cases = n())
blank_theme <- theme_minimal()+
  theme(
  axis.title.x = element_blank(),
  axis.title.y = element_blank(),
  panel.border = element_blank(),
  panel.grid=element_blank(),
  axis.ticks = element_blank(),
  plot.title=element_text(size=14, face="bold")
  )
table_relationship %>%
  ggplot(aes(x="", y= cases, fill = Relationship_with_murder)) + 
  geom_bar(color = 'white', width = 1, stat = 'identity') + 
  coord_polar("y", start=0) + 
  blank_theme + 
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank()) +
  geom_text(aes(label = cases),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Have they known each other?", fill = "Relationship with murder") 
```

---

## 3. Gender:

We wanted to count the Victim Sex and see the graph so the data is filtered here and in my findings, there is a higher percent for a male to be murdered than a female.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# I wanted to count the Victim Sex and see the graph 
filtered_data %>% count(Victim.Sex)
```

```{r,fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
# Graph for Victim Sex
filtered_data %>% ggplot(aes(Victim.Sex, fill = Victim.Sex)) + 
  geom_bar(color = 'black') + theme_bw() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = "count", vjust = 5) + 
  labs(title = "Which gender is the most targeted?", 
       x = "Victim Gender", y = "Cases", fill = "Victim Gender")
```

---

Then we wanted to see the correlation based on the victim's gender and it's perpetrator relationship.

```{r,fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
# We wanted to see victim's gender and the correlation of their relationship?
relationship_data %>% ggplot(aes(Victim.Sex, fill = Relationship_with_murder)) + 
  geom_bar(color = 'black') + 
  theme_bw()+ 
  geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = "count", vjust = 1) + 
  labs(title = "How many cases do they know each other by genders? ", 
       x = "Victim Gender", y = "Cases", fill = "Relationship with murder")
```

_From above graph, it is obvious that most of victims know the murders before the incident_

---

## 4. Age: 

__How does the distribution of cases look like by victim's age?__

```{r,fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
filtered_data %>% ggplot(aes(Victim.Age)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = 'Black', fill = 'white', binwidth = 3) +
  labs(x = "Victim Age", y = "Cases") 
```


_We could see that the average age of a victim to be most likely murdered are the ages 21-25. However, it is not really clear to determine if the age is an effected factor on the rate of murder cases. So, let's take a look at this flow._


```{r,echo=FALSE,message=F,warning=F}
library(gifski)
library(ggthemes)
table_age <- filtered_data %>% group_by(Victim.Age) %>% summarise(cases = n())
plot <- table_age %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Victim.Age, y= cases)) + 
  geom_line(alpha=1,colour='white') + 
  theme_solarized_2(light=F)+
  labs(title="The change of murder cases over Victim's Ages", x = "Victim Age", y = "Cases") +
  theme(text=element_text(colour="#EEEEEE"),
        title=element_text(colour="#EEEEEE",size=9,face = "bold"),
        plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5),
        axis.title.x = element_text(),
        panel.grid.minor.x=element_blank(),
        legend.background = element_blank(),
        legend.key= element_blank(),
        legend.position=c(0.095, 0.81), ## legend at top-left, inside the plot
        plot.margin = unit(c(0.5,1.3,0.5,0.5), "cm"))
plot.animation=plot+
  transition_reveal(Victim.Age)+
  view_follow(fixed_y=T)

 
animate(plot.animation, height=420,width=700,fps=30,duration=10,end_pause = 120,res=100,rewind=F, renderer = gifski_renderer())
anim_save("The change of murder cases over Victim's Ages.gif")
```


---

# Summary

Based on our findings some important takeaway from our analysis is that the perpetrator gets acquainted with the victims before committing murder . The victims of females are more likely to be known by them. Also, men are more likely to be murdered than women. The underlying factors and motives of a serial killer is that they all may have different motives, where it can be in desperate need of money, sex, power, etc but they are prepare to kill again and again. Lastly, the most used weapon to kill was a handgun. It makes us wonder if gun law's were regulated in each state, would it reduce crime since it is easily accessible to acquire one.
